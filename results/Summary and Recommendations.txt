Analysis Summary
The analysis reveals several key insights regarding accident occurrences:

Time of Day: A significant number of accidents happen during the daytime when visibility is generally lower, indicating potential factors such as glare or distractions affecting drivers.

Weather Conditions: Interestingly, precipitation does not significantly increase the likelihood of accidents, as most incidents occur in fair and clear weather conditions. This suggests that other factors, such as driver behavior or road conditions, may play a more critical role in accident occurrences.

Road Infrastructure: The presence of road safety features such as roundabouts, traffic signals, and road bumps significantly reduces the chances of accidents. These infrastructure elements likely contribute to better traffic management and driver awareness.

Traffic Impact: The majority of accidents result in moderate traffic disruptions, indicating that while accidents cause delays, they are often manageable and do not lead to severe congestion.

Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, the following recommendations can be made to enhance road safety and minimize accident occurrences:

Enhanced Daytime Visibility: Implement measures to improve visibility during the day, such as better road signage, clearer lane markings, and increased lighting at critical intersections. Awareness campaigns can also educate drivers about the dangers of distractions and glare during daylight hours.

Road Safety Education: Launch educational programs aimed at drivers to raise awareness about safe driving practices in clear weather conditions. Emphasizing that weather is not the only factor affecting road safety can help instill a more cautious mindset among drivers.

Infrastructure Improvements: Prioritize the installation of roundabouts, traffic signals, and road bumps in accident-prone areas. Regular assessments of road infrastructure can help identify locations that would benefit from these safety features.

Traffic Management Strategies: Implement real-time traffic monitoring systems to manage congestion more effectively following accidents. Utilizing technology to reroute traffic can help minimize delays and improve overall traffic flow.
